Subject: GE Information Internship & Full-Time Hire Info Session @ 12/03 7:00-7:40PM Dana 134



On Monday 12/03 from 7:00 - 7:40 PM in Dana 134, a Bucknell recruiting team representative from GE Capital, Mr. Joe O'Connor, will be giving a presentation including an overview of General Electric (company structure, culture, and initiatives) as well as a highlight of current internship and full-time hire opportunities.  GE has impressive involvement with the undergraduate Bucknell community through many outlets (the Institute of Leadership in Technology and Management (ILTM), for instance) which have led many students into internships and full-time employment opportunities at GE. 



Pizza and drinks will be served!


Best,
Rob
