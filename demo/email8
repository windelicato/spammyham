Dear ENGR 100 Students (and EE Juniors and Senior) --- this is an

INVITATION TO OUR "BUILDING A PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPH"- PARTY!!

You don't know what a photoplethysmograph is? - Well, come and find out!

The electrical engineering freshmen have received a little (unassembled) =
PCB circuit board from us. This circuit board is the basic building =
block for our photoplethysmograph. If you have received one bring it =
along. If you do not have one then come along anyways because we always =
have a few extra and we WELCOME STUDENTS FROM ANY MAJOR (especially the =
ones from the "undecided" major).=20

We will meet this coming Thursday, August, 30, between 3:00pm and 5:00pm =
in DANA 305.

In those two hours we will help you build YOUR OWN photoplethysmograph.

HOW COOL IS THAT! - Hope to see many of you there. - Best wishes - =
Robert Nickel

PS.: A plethysmograph is a device that measures changes in the volume of =
some organ in the body. Changes in the blood flow to an organ as the =
heart beats will cause its volume to change, so by detecting that change =
in volume we can observe the pulse rate. A photoplethysmograph uses =
light to detect how the amount of blood in your capillaries changes. =
Blood absorbs infrared light well, so by shining an infrared LED into =
your skin and measuring the amount of light that is reflected we can =
observe how the volume of the capillaries increases every time the heart =
beats.
