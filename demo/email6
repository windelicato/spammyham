On Friday November 30th we will have the project presentations. We will
begin presentations in the first hour of class (from 1:00pm till 1:52pm)
and continue in the second hour (from 3:00pm till 3:52pm). The sequence of
presenters/presentations is as follows (order was selected at random):=20



To make sure that the presentations will be successful I have to insist on
the following rules:=20

1) Your presentation must not be longer than 5 minutes.
2) You may have no less then 3 PowerPoint slides and not more than 5.
3) Your peers are the audience of your presentation. You will be graded on
how well you present to your peers (and NOT to the instructor!).
4) During your presentation you must explain (i) what it is you are doing,
and (ii) in what way probability is involved in the process. You will not
have any time to discuss details! For some topics a short demo of the
discussed procedure/algorithm/program and/or its output may be
appropriate.
5) Not all members of the group have to talk (but they must be present).
6) Attendance at all presentations is mandatory for everyone. People that
skip presentations will loose points!
7) You must send the PowerPoint of your presentation to me via email by
Thursday night.
8) Even though the syllabus says differently: there will be NO peer
evaluations.=20

Please note that any group that violates these rules (as well as anything
announced in class) will loose points.=20

This year we have a particularly interesting selection of topics and I am
very much looking forward to hearing about what each of you has done with
it=E2=80=A6=20

Best wishes - RMN=20
