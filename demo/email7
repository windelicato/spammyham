Dear All,=20

I decided to make the ELEC 471 project proposal due on Monday November
5th. Please note that November 5th is the day on which your proposed
project has to be approved by me, i.e. you should check with me if your
proposed idea is feasible BEFORE the deadline.=20

Please, carefully read the guidelines in the course syllabus concerning
the project. The proposal itself can be fairly short. You need a title for
your project, a list with the names of the (two) members of each group, =
and
a short description (one or two paragraphs) about what you are planning to
do.=20

Best wishes - RMN=20
